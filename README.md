# Names Calculator
This project was made for speed measurement. It is desirable to compare with other languages.
Question:
There are many names in the "names.txt" file. These names are randomly ordered. We list the list and we have the total name scoring.

Sample:
The name "COLIN" is in the 938th place after the whole list is sorted by name.
C = 3,
O = 15,
L = 12,
I = 9,
N = 14,

Sum of letters: 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53
Name Score: 938 * 53 = 49714;

The list is calculated for all the names in this way and the sum of the results is requested. Answer: 871198282
